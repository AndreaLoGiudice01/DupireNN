# DupireNN

Neural network local volatility with dupire formula.

Implementation is contained dupireNN.ipynb notebook. Due to gitHub size limitation (25mb max per file), outputs from our notebook have been deleted. Only code is still present in this notebook.

BS folder contains some python scripts for implied volatility calibration.

This is fully compatible with collab but can also be used on a local notebook environment provided that tensorflow is installed for python 3 with a version superior than 2.0.
In that case, you should ignore cells starting with "from google.colab import files".

Several days of market data are listed in data folder.
Notebook indicate which file you should load for execution.
